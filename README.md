# Udacity_Project_1


## Motivation:

The following project has been created as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025

Using the Munich Airbnb dataset, this project aims to answer three questions of interest:

1. In which months are most Airbnb listings still available (total and by room type)?
2. In which Munich areas (zip codes) are the best airbnb listings (according to total rating)?
3. Do less expensive listings have a lower rating compared to expensive listings?
