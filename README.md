# Udacity_Project_1


## Motivation

The following project has been created as part of the [Udacity Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)

Using the Munich Airbnb dataset, this project aims to answer the following three questions of interest:

1. In which months are most Airbnb listings still available (total and by room type)?
2. In which Munich areas (zip codes) are the best airbnb listings (according to total rating)?
3. Do less expensive listings have a lower rating compared to expensive listings? 


## Files

This project uses data from the [Munich AirBnB dataset](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) 

The analysis includes detailed listings data (download: listings.csv.gz) as well as detailed calendar data for listings (download: calendar.csv.gz). The unzipped data are stored in the Data folder of this project.

The udacity_project_1.ipynb  - Jupyter notebook includes the full project analysis for all three questions.
